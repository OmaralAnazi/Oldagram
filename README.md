# Oldagram

## Description
"Oldagram" is a solo project I developed in the Scrimba Front-End Developer Program, inspired by the basic functionalities of Instagram. This simplified version of a social media platform displays dummy data posts, each with a comment section. Users can like and unlike posts, and the application utilizes local storage to remember the likes, ensuring persistence even after a page refresh.

## Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Learnings
- Manipulating DOM elements to update likes and comments dynamically.
- Implementing local storage to retain user interactions across sessions.
- Creating a user interface that mimics social media post interactions.
- Handling event listeners to respond to user actions like liking a post.

## Setup
To view the Oldagram site, clone the repository and open `index.html` in your web browser.
